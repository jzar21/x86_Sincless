# x86_Sincless
An useless, inefficient and probably unsafe synchronization library for x86 architecture.

## Why?
Because assembly and computer architecture are fun :)

# How compile and execute it
You can compile it with the `CMakeLists.txt` provided on this proyect
with the next commands:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
cd ..
```

Then you can execute the examples with the commands:
```bash
./build/example1
./build/example2
```
and all the examples that you want to try.

You can also build the `Doxygen` documentation activating
the option `BUILD_DOC` on the file `CMakeLists.txt`.
